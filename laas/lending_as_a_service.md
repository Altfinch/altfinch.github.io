## Introduction

We are providing a lending as a service solution to both Fintechs and NBFCs. You can connect your systems to our platform through a plethora of APIs or can directly use our platform for managing your lending portfolio.

### Terminologies

Before we get started, Let's get familiar with a few terms which we are going to use through out the documentation.

- **Applicant** - Person/business who is trying to avail a loan. 
- **Application** - Details regarding the loan like purpose, amount, product preference. 
- **Molecule** - Every co-lending partnership is unique in it's arrangement, so we have designed the system in a way that everything is configurable (policy criteria, maximum loan amount, allowed products etc.). A molecule represents a co-lending arrangement between a Fintech and a NBFC.
- **LSP** - Loan service provider is synonym for the fintech who is bearing the credit risk without maintaining any regulatory capital.
- **Lender** - An NBFC/bank who is underwriting the loan.

In short, each loan through a LSP is applied by an applicant with application and is binded by a molecule, capital for which will be provided by the lender.
